//Use For Loops to solve the following problems.



//Part 1
//Write a program in C to display the first 10 natural numbers.
//Expected Output:
//1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

//Part 2
//Write a program in C to display the cube of the number up to an integer.
//Expected Output:
//Input number of terms: 5
//Number is: 1 and cube of the 1 is: 1
//Number is: 2 and cube of the 2 is: 8
//Number is: 3 and cube of the 3 is: 27
//Number is: 4 and cube of the 4 is: 64
//Number is: 5 and cube of the 5 is: 125

//Part 3
//Write a program in C to display the multiplication table of a given integer.
//Expected Output:
//Input the number (Table to be calculated): 15
//15 X 1 = 15
//...
//15 X 10 = 150




//Part 4
//Write a C# Sharp program to display an alphabet pattern like Y with an asterisk.
//Hint: Use nested loop
//Expected Output:
// *     *
//  *   *
//   * *
//    *
//    *
//    *
//    *

// Part 5: Character Health Regeneration
// Simulate the regeneration of a game character's health over 5 rounds. Display the character's health after each round, regenerating 10 health points per round.
// Expected Output:
// Round 1: Health 10
// Round 2: Health 20
// ...
// Round 5: Health 50




/////////// For Each Loop ///////////

//Use For Each Loops to solve the following problems.

//Part 6
// Create an list of names and iterate through each name and display the name.
//Expected Output:
//Name: John
//Name: James
//Name: Luke
//Name: Lila

//Part 7
