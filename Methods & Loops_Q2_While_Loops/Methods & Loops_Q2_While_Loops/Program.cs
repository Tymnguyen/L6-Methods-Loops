//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the numbers 1 to 10 to the console.





//Part 2
//Create a program that uses a while loop to print out the numbers 10 to 1 to the console.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the numbers 10 to 1 to the console.




//Part 3
//Create a program that uses a while loop to print out the even numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the even numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.





//Part 4
//Create a program that uses a while loop to print out the odd numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the odd numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.




//Part 5
//Write a C# Sharp program that takes a number as input and print its multiplication table.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the multiplication table of a number.
//Test Data:
//Enter the number: 5
//Expected Output:
//5 * 0 = 0
//5 * 1 = 5
//5 * 2 = 10
//5 * 3 = 15
//....
//5 * 10 = 50




//Part 6
//Write a C# Sharp program that takes a number as input and print its factorial.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to calculate the factorial of a number.
//Test Data:
//Enter the number: 5
//Expected Output:
//The factorial of 5 is: 120





//Part 7
//Write a C# Sharp program that takes a number as input and print the series 1+2+3+ ... +n = sum
//Hint: You can use a while loop to calculate the sum of a series.
//Test Data:
//Enter the number: 5
//Expected Output:
//1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15







//Part 8
//Write a program in C# Sharp to display the multiplication table horizontally from 1 to n.
//Hint: You can use conseol.write to print out the multiplication table horizontally.
//Test Data:
//Input upto the table number starting from 1 : 8
//Expected Output:
//Multiplication table from 1 to 8
//1x1 = 1, 2x1 = 2, 3x1 = 3, 4x1 = 4, 5x1 = 5, 6x1 = 6, 7x1 = 7, 8x1 = 8
//...
//1x10 = 10, 2x10 = 20, 3x10 = 30, 4x10 = 40, 5x10 = 50, 6x10 = 60, 7x10 = 70, 8x10 = 80






//Part 9
//Write a program in C# Sharp to display a pattern like a right angle triangle with a number.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the pattern.
//Test Data:
//Input number of rows : 3
//Expected Output:
//1
//12
//123








//Part 10
//Write a program in C# Sharp to display the pattern like right angle triangle using an asterisk.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the pattern.
//Test Data:
//Input number of rows : 3
//Expected Output:
//*
//**
//***






//Part 11
//Write a program in C# Sharp to make such a pattern like a pyramid with numbers increasing by 1.
//Hint: You can use a while loop to print out the pattern.
//Test Data:
//Input number of rows : 5
//Expected Output:
//    1
//   2 3
//  4 5 6
// 7 8 9 10
//11 12 13 14 15



////////////////Do While Loop////////////////


//while loop: Condition is checked before the loop body runs.

//do-while loop: Loop body runs at least once before checking the condition.

//Example(Uncomment each loop type to see the difference) 


//While Loop//

//int x = 1;
//while (x < 1)
//{
//    Console.WriteLine(x);
//    x++;
//}



//Do While Loop//

//int x = 1;
//do
//{
//    Console.WriteLine(x);
//    x++;
//} while (x < 1);
